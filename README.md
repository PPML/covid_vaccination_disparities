# Quantifying and benchmarking disparities in COVID-19 vaccination rates by race/ethnicity

### This repository contains replication [data](https://github.com/PPML/covid_vaccination_disparities/tree/main/data) and [code](https://github.com/PPML/covid_vaccination_disparities/tree/main/code) for our [manuscript](https://github.com/PPML/covid_vaccination_disparities/blob/main/Manuscript.pdf).

Summary: We analyzed vaccination data collated from state websites and corrected for missing and inconsistent reports in order to develop comparable estimates of vaccine coverage by state and race/ethnicity over time. Based on our estimated coverage levels on April 1, we modeled three scenarios for vaccine scale-up between April 1 and July 1, encompassing the period after vaccine eligibility opened to all adults. Comparing actual coverage levels on July 1 to scenario benchmarks, we evaluated progress towards vaccine equity and identified states that were able to achieve more equitable vaccination rates. Our analysis provide a map of how vaccination disparities evolved during the first six months of the campaign, and highlights how pro-equity strategies, including place-based prioritization of vaccination efforts, could help to close coverage gaps.
  
Results for each state are available [here](https://github.com/PPML/covid_vaccination_disparities/blob/main/State%20Projections.pdf).
